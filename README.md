Healthcare consumers nowadays rely on various online resources, such as hospital review sites like Yelp and
Mouthshut, as well as social media, to make informed decisions when selecting a hospital or clinic for consultation.
This paper investigates the use of opinion mining on textual data extracted from hospital review sites, and proposes
the use of data visualization tools like PowerBI or Tableau to aid patients in identifying good hospitals easily. The
visualization techniques presented in this project include faceted and filtered visualization, which allow for a more
advanced analysis of the sentiment expressed in the reviews.

The dashboard makes the work easier and one can search for the hospitals in this dashboard. It shows the overall review,location,speciality 
and rating for a particular hospital when searched. It also helps the admin to know about the count of reviews and the people's good or bad reviews associated to it.
