We were notified that there was going to be a change to Tricare as far as who it fell under, but not the drastic increases in all coverage fees and that's IF you can find a Dr. or Hospital that will accept your insurance. All Dr.'s and Hospitals are dropping the insurance and you have to drive 40 min or more to find a specialist who will still accept it. The fees have doubled, tripled and quadrupled depending on the service you need. All fees have drastically increased. This is not what I was told I'd have when I retired.  \n",

However, they and Humana refuse to correct the bill. So now both of us have bills that are processed as out of network when they should have been processed as in network. Sort of a gotcha by Humana.

There seemed to be more helpful information as part of their program and they had a better customer service set up. It was quicker and easier to reach their offices, ask questions, and get answers. Most calls to Humana result in a robot telling me that the humans are busy with other calls and I can do better calling back on a Tuesday after 4 pm. I have called back after 4 pm and been told that they are closed and to call back the next day. When I finally reach them it's a general customer service rep who seems to flip a coin as to which \"specialist\" she wants to send me to. While holding for the specialist I get hung up on and have to start all over again. It's very time consuming. \n",

I think they should quit sending out nonsense mail offerings, and other unnecessary junk mail and fix their website, which is now worse than ever.

On 11/29/2016 I had a minor cold, called my doctor for an appointment, he was on vacation, so I went to the walk-in-clinic, same clinic that my doctor is in. I was treated by a physicianâ€™s assistant. My co-pay should have been $10 but I was billed $40. I called Unity Points billing dept. They filed a dispute. I thought it was because I was treated by a PA. I was told by my doctorâ€™s office that they coded it wrong, so I thought it was because I was seen by a PA, and not by my doctor who is a DO. Then last month 11/2017 I received another bill for $40. Same PA's name, same 2016 date. So I again called Unity Points billing dept and was told that Humana declined the dispute claiming the coding was correct. \n",

No recourse now but to take Humana to court. It is fraudulent to solicit a customer without alerting him to significant holes he is likely to encounter in his coverage. Also, Piedmont was remiss to tell someone on a fixed income that he can afford to fork over 25% of his income to that hospital, because of Humana, is obscene.

            "Review: I was told that Humana no longer serves any part of the state of Georgia. I was surprised to find out my 76 father carries it when he had a mini stroke last month. We paid over 2000 dollars monthly until Obamacare brought it down drastically. I still paid a lot out of pocket and I'm not sickly. But last year my husband had a too high red count, was sent to a oncologist only to find out it was his red rice supplement causing it and a month later I had to get blood transfusion sent to an oncologist only to find out I was anemic. I take an iron pill daily. Suddenly I was told Georgia was not carrying Humana anymore. Liar liar it does. Several family members have it. So does many businesses. I was told by a lawyer they have violated my rights because I had the highest bracket they carried. I paid the most out of pocket and the first four payments would have paid the bills the paid. I made them a lot of money. This company is crooks and thieves. Shame on them. \n",
